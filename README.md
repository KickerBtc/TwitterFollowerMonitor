# TwitterFollowerMonitor

A Twitter bot I wrote to monitor followers and unfollowers. It sends an email every 12 hours with a report on who followed or unfollowed the account you are tracking.

Pulls an arbitrary 500 followers as the maximum - if the tracked account has more than 500 followers this number should be changed to reflect that.

Written for my friend Noah. Noahnfollowers, no unfollowers.
